# Breakout V0.1

This is the breakout game from the MDN web docs
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript

However, my objective with this repo is refactoring the tutorial's code to make it reusable and also add new features.

It is currently a WIP.

TODO:

* Add new features such as power-ups and sounds
* Add unit tests
